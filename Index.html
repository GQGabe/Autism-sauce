					<h2> Hello World! </h2>
					<p>Hi, I am the Autistic Chef. I am a young adult with ASD and I am creating this blog to document my journey towards self reliance. Please join me as I strive to reach my goals. I could never have enough recipe testers as I try out things in life. Bon Appetite!

(If this is not clear already, I am Autistic, I am an adult, I am trying to learn how to person. And adult. The following entries are to catalogue and consider my efforts in a way that holds me accountable to my goals. I love to cook, but I am an aspiring graphic designer. I think about design when I cook and I think about cooking when I design. 

A recipe is a set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including a list of the ingredients required: a traditional Indonesian recipe.
• something which is likely to lead to a particular outcome: sky-high interest rates are a recipe for disaster.

In my experience as a late diagnosis ASD person, I know that I can do most things, but what I have to do is find the way that works for me. My own personal recipe.


This is also a selfish blog. I have see so many people on YouTube and social media benefit massively from having a network of people who can help with research and learning. I think that having some friends who understand what I am aiming for would be a big asset.
