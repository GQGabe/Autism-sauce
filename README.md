# Autism-sauce
A personal blog.
This is just a site that I am building from scratch with the intention of solidifying my dev skills and my design skills.
I indend to use this as both a tool and an opportunity to grow. If by some chance somebody sees this and wants to give me a tip
help me with anything I would greatly appreciate the help. If you like this for any reason please feel free to follow along as
I build this thing. please don't steal my site or my content. its all free source to the best of my knowledge and the code is
all from me and my research and learning from home.
